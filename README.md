# homework4

For this assignment I was to make a quiz.
This quiz needed to have a timer that counted down in seconds, and lost extra time for wrong answers.
The quiz needed to progress through the quiz whenever an answer choice was selected, and the score adjusted accordingly.
The score needed to be stored in local storage, and ranked with all other scores for this quiz.
The user should be able to enter their initials next to their score.

I did not get that far.
I managed to have a very short quiz with a timer and a score, and the quiz ends when time runs out or there are no more questions.
But the timer counts down after the quiz is over, and no information is  saved between playthroughs of this quiz.
Players also cannot enter their initials.

I have been really struggling with a lot of Javascript and specifically making DOM manipulation work.
I will probably rewatch the previous week's lectures and re try this homework with less help from youtube videos and google, but 
for now I am submitting a barely functional quiz.
